### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Charlie, I have recently completed the 16 week full stack coding bootcamp at the 'School of Code'. 

Before the School of Code I worked a lot in hospitality with a lot of experience as a barista. I am now transitioning from working with one kind of Java to another.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Creating a chess App that will be useable to play chess against your friends online. Check it out in the repo below! I started this project to test myself and see if I can work out the complicated logic required within the game.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working my way through the Havrard CS50 course to pick up some computer science knowledge and learn a bit more about how to make my code more effiecient.
